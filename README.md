# BNN_order_statistics
I use normal distribution order statistics to replace batch normalizations in binary neural networks. I show that this avoids some BatchNorm problems, with little cost.

The FormulasForRenorm file contains the full explanation of the method, with a demonstration on a CNN classifier.
The second notebook is there to demonstrate the beneficial effects of this method on an autoencoder.
